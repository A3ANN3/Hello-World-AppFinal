#My Reflection 

To host my app, I created a simple Hello World webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my phone. I uploaded the files to a public GitHub repository using the GitHub mobile app. After that, I enabled GitHub Pages in the repository settings. One challenge I faced was making sure the files were uploaded in the root folder, which I fixed by re-uploading them correctly. After a short wait, GitHub generated a live link for my project. Cloud hosting makes my project useful because it allows others to access it online anytime.
